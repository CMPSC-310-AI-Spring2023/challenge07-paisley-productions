#### (Welcome guest to the show sequence)
Pallas (Host) : Hello welcome back everyone to the Paisley Show! Tonight we have a very special guest, Haylee Pierce. Haylee is an experineced computer science student with a lot of experience with AI. Today they are going to discuss with us their thoughts on AI in education. Hello, how are you feeling today?

Haylee (CS Student Guest) : I am feeling great. 

Pallas (Host) : That's great to hear. So jumping into this we have recently heard there has been a lot of fears on campus about AI taking over education. Let's take a look at what the CS students have been saying.

#### First Interview; scared CS student

Pallas (Inteviewer) : What are your feelings about AI in education?

Student 1 : To be honest, I am so *scared* about AI replacing the need for me as a CS student. Like AI can write its own code instantly?! Like how am I supposed to compete with that??

Pallas (Host) : Wow that was pretty intense. How do you respond?

Haylee (CS Student Guest) : Well, while their fears are valid, I would have to comment that there will always be a demand for people to fix and debug the code itself. AI can only be as good as you train it to be, leaving that necessary human element.

Pallas (Host) : Ok that makes a lot of sense. Now let's see how the professors are feeling.

#### (Second Interview; scared professor

Pallas (Inteviewer) : What are your feelings about AI in education?

Professor 1 : AI is going to develop into the easiest way out for students. If you already think students cheat a lot, the current AI is starting to write profiecient essays that it is so hard to check if there's plagerism. It is already driving me crazy and it'll only get worse.

Pallas (Host) : I see, professors are scared of plargerism running rampant. As a CS student do you think that's what it's going to develop into?

Haylee (CS Student Guest) : Plagerism is definetly something to look out for especially with all these new technologies. However, with the rise in AI that use natural language processing we also are getting AI able to detect Chat GPT. Plagerism checkers like Turnitin use machine learning as well as human experience to be able to detect text generated by AI such as Chat GPT (source https://schoolio.com/can-teachers-detect-chatgpt/).

Pallas (Host) :  Wow that's super good news to hear. I was really worried about how people might take advantage and break the honor code using AI. Next let's check what a student outside of Computer Science has to say.

#### Third Interview; scared non-CS student

Pallas (Inteviewer) : What are your feelings about AI in education?

Student 2 : AI is so scary and confusing and I hate how they are trying to steal all our information to train them things. And I don't even know how they could be impacting the environment.
